# Adopting an API

This is my first attempt at the adopting an API assignment for front-end foxes school. In this browser extension my goal is to
list out nearby breweries based on the city the user inputs. I have tried using a GET request from the API and then I tried to use
a POST request but I can't seem to figure out the response function for the breweries based on which city is inputed.
